# **XDCGram: Bridging Blockchain with WhatsApp Messaging**

### **Overview**
**XDCGram** is an AI-powered WhatsApp-based messaging agent built on the **XDC Network**, enabling seamless interaction with blockchain technology. With simple text-based commands, users can execute on-chain transactions, send funds, swap tokens, check real-time market data, manage smart contracts, and participate in prediction markets â€” all within WhatsApp.  
**XDCGram** eliminates barriers to blockchain adoption, making crypto transactions accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly.

Unlike Telegram, which is commonly used for blockchain bots, WhatsApp is the worldâ€™s most widely used messaging platform, with over 2 billion users globally.  
By integrating blockchain functionality directly into WhatsApp, **XDCGram** removes the need for additional apps, making crypto transactions as easy as sending a message.  
This approach ensures greater accessibility, particularly in regions where financial inclusion is limited but WhatsApp usage is high.
